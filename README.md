## :computer: Technologies

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) and [Puppeteer](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer).

## :construction_worker: Getting Started

**First of all, make sure that you have installed [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [YARN](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install#windows-stable), so you can go ahead with the following steps:**

1. Clone the project:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/gabrielhs1357/twitch-viewer-bot.git
   ```
   
2. Install the dependencies:

   ```
   yarn
   ```
   
3. Create a copy of `.env.sample` file and rename it to `.env`.

4. Set up your `.env` file. Here's a brief explanation of each variable and an example:

- AUTH_TOKEN: this will allow you to open Twitch and already be signed in. You can find your auth token on the cookies of your browser. Go to `http://twitch.tv`, sign in using your Twitch account and find your auth token at your `browser developer tools -> cookies -> auth-token`.
- CHANNELS: put all the channels that you want the bot to be watching separated by commas.
- HEADLESS: Puppeteer launches Chromium in headless mode (true) by default, but you can set this behavior using this variable. Remember this is an **optional** variable and the default value is **true**.
    
    ```shell    
    AUTH_TOKEN=your_auth_token
    CHANNELS=channel_1,channel_2,channel_3
    HEADLESS=true_or_false
    ```

5. Start the application in development environment:

    ```shell    
    yarn dev
    ```
